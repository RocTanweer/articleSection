# Article Section
A Landing page for a **Article Card** section.
<br>
Not very responsive but it's Made with Love for screen width 1440px, 1024px, 768px and 375px 
</br>
In order to use the relative unit for measurements, I used **Sass Function** to convert pixel to rems
</br>
This is my second Js project. I really messed up in organizing my codes.
</br>
Any feedback Please...
</br>
Thank You!
</br>
